openaos-gen9
============

For now, this is all quite quick and dirty and needs further testing, especially with other devices than the G9 80 Turbo (OMAP4460)

Thanks to the guys from #openpma, #git and #kernel for their support!

This repo is mostly derived from http://gitorious.org/archos-buildroots/gen8
The kernel is here: https://www.gitorious.org/archos/archos-gpl-gen9-kernel-ics/commits/linux-ics-3.0.21

Note: for the newer toolchains (as in this buildroot), some patches need to be made to the kernel

The configuration files are in buildroot/local/debug/
Once the quirks are out, I'll write it up properly and move the debug-stuff to another branch.

Happy hunting!

Daniel
